**Hi, I'm Juno Woods, PhD.**

I do spacecraft navigation, state estimation, and mission design, with a focus on lunar missions. Sometimes I dabble in space settlement policy as well.

I perform engineering work on a contract basis. Please do reach out if you're interested in hiring Translunar LLC. My email address is at the bottom of the page and my CV is linked in the upper right-hand corner.

My pronouns are they/them. I find that, in the aerospace industry, folks don't talk about gender or pronouns much. If you have questions, [MyPronouns.org](https://www.mypronouns.org) is a useful resource &mdash; or you can just ask me.
